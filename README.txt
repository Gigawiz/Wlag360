Wlag360 is a Wireless Lag Switch I created in C# to effectively "Lag" the other players of a multiplayer game, allowing you to gain kills, etc.
Please note, as with any lag switch, you MUST be host of the game to use this, otherwise you will just lag yourself out.
I had originally created this project as closed source with extra tools for xbox 360 profile & game save modding, but no one was activly using the program, so i closed the site and took down the program.
This is a remake, that will not have all the excess tools that the first release had, and is now open source, released under the Creative Commons Share Alike V3 License.
Changelog:

V1
Gui Designed (again)
Lag code added
Splash Screen Added
Installer Created
